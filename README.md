# Use Case

- How architecture application MVC with React Native

# Advantage
### Enhanced Maintainability
 <p>The clear separation of concerns between the Model, View, and Controller facilitates code maintenance. This allows developers to focus on specific areas of the application without directly impacting other parts.</p> 

### Flexibility for Changes
<p> A significant advantage of MVC is the ability to make changes in one part of the application without directly affecting other parts. This flexibility is particularly beneficial in scenarios where frequent updates are needed, enabling greater flexibility in development and maintenance.</p>

### Improved Fault Tolerance
<p>The Model acts as the controller of data, ensuring that data changes are performed correctly. This improves fault tolerance since there's a separate layer to manage and manipulate data.</p>

### Greater Scalability
<p> The clear separation between the Model, View, and Controller allows views to be independent of the Model and Controller. This promotes greater scalability, facilitating application expansion without directly impacting other parts of the codebase.</p>

# Disadvantages of the MVC Pattern

### Testing Complexity
Due to the strong coupling between the View layer and the rest of the application, testing can become complicated. Efficient and isolated unit testing, especially in the View layer, can be challenging.

### Growing Complexity in the Controller Layer
Over time, it's common for code complexity to increase in the Controller layer. As more business logic and interactions are added, careful management and organization of the code may be necessary to maintain clarity and maintainability.

### Additional Observations about the Pattern
Despite its clear advantages, the MVC pattern requires a solid understanding of how to properly separate and organize responsibilities between the Model, View, and Controller. Additionally, the ongoing evolution of the application may require adaptations to the MVC structure to maintain efficiency and scalability.
To optimize the use of MVC in React Native, it's essential to seek best practices and coding standards that help mitigate the identified disadvantages, ensuring a balance between code flexibility and maintainability.

# Observations about Pattern

- The MVC pattern in React Native provides a valuable organizational framework for application development, enabling clear separation of responsibilities and promoting code maintainability. However, it's crucial to be aware of associated disadvantages and adopt practices that minimize these challenges, ensuring a robust and scalable application.
